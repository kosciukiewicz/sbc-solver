Playing on the left of midfield in all of Germany’s games, Schweinsteiger’s standout performance was undoubtedly in the third-place play-off against Portugal. Germany won 3-1 thanks to two thunderous long-range strikes from Schweinsteiger and he also fired in the free-kick which Petit turned into his own net for Germany’s other goal.",

Torres’ first season back in Madrid saw him help the club reach the 2015-16 UEFA Champions League final where they fell agonizingly short against rivals Real Madrid on a penalty shoot-out. Torres ended his spell back at Atlético on a high, however, as he was part of the squad that won the 2017-18 UEFA Europa League.",
  "FUT_LEGEND_DESCR_256871": "Fernando Torres displayed his greatness on many occasions throughout his career, but perhaps none of those moments epitomised his supreme ability to hit the back of the net more than his unbelievable volley at Anfield in 2009.

He then wheeled away to the delight of the Santiago Bernabéu faithful who celebrated his first trophy for the Spanish giants.",
  "FUT_LEGEND_DESCR_25924": "Joan Capdevila was not renowned for his goalscoring exploits over the course of his career, despite his attacking nature from left-back, but one occasion that does stick in mind is the brace he netted during a LALIGA encounter against Getafe in 2009. His first was a well struck right-footed effort from the edge of the area, before being on hand to tap home in the final minutes and give 10-man Villarreal a 3-2 victory.",

  "FUT_LEGEND_DESCR_261395": "2012 was a special year for Iker Casillas. By then, he was captain of both Real Madrid and Spain and he led his club to win the fifth and final LALIGA title of his career in the 2011-12 season.

  "FUT_LEGEND_DESCR_261997": "With all their success on the European and world stage, the Spain team of the late 2000s and early 2010s were undoubtedly one of the best national teams of all time.

From Nani’s deflected cross, Rooney’s acrobatics sent the ball arrowing into the top corner with Joe Hart rooted to the spot. A key moment in the title race as United went on to regain the trophy from Chelsea.",

His four goals on the way to a third-place finish for the Netherlands made his last appearance at a major international tournament a memorable one.",
  "FUT_LEGEND_DESCR_262112": "Robin van Persie was named Arsenal club captain following a standout 2010-11 Premier League campaign, but his tremendous form during this period couldn't propel the Gunners to the Premier League title. It was his desire to win the competition that saw him move north to Manchester United in 2012 where he followed his Golden Boot in 2011-12 with another in 2012-13, scoring 26 goals to help secure his first Premier League title in his debut season for the Red Devils.",

He took the challenge in his stride, helping Real Madrid win back-to-back LALIGA titles in 2006-07 and 2007-08, the latter of which saw him collect double-digit assists for the first time in his career.",
  "FUT_LEGEND_DESCR_266473": "The 2010-11 Premier League title race was a closely fought battle, particularly between Manchester United and Chelsea. When the two sides met with three games to go, the result would go a long way to determining the destination of the title and Park Ji Sung made sure he had his say. In the very first minute of the match, United’s unsung hero slid the ball through the heart of Chelsea’s defence for Chicharito to set the Red Devils on their way to victory and the Premier League trophy.",
  "FUT_LEGEND_DESCR_266690": "The Inter side of 2009-10 was one of the most special in the club’s illustrious history and Lúcio was a key member at the heart of its back line. The Brazilian was a rock for the Nerazzurri and part of a defence that struck fear into Europe’s elite, conceding just three goals in the knockout stages of their 2009-10 UEFA Champions League success as they rounded off a famous treble in style with a 2-0 win over Bayern Munich.",
  "FUT_LEGEND_DESCR_266691": "2010 was an impressive year for Diego Forlán as he won multiple trophies, with the first coming during the Europa League Final vs Fulham. Forlán scored the opener by redirecting a wayward Sergio Agüero shot with the side of his boot before Fulham immediately equalised the score. He would later become the hero in extra time when he again combined his skill with Agüero to pounce on a cross with a lovely flick. Forlán later secured the Man of the Match award and Atlético Madrid’s first Europa League trophy.",
  "FUT_LEGEND_DESCR_266694": "Saeed Al Owairan spent his entire career at hometown club Al Shabab, and his most successful spell there was arguably during the early 1990s. The 1993 Crown Prince Cup Final was one of those highlights as Al Owairan scored the opener when he ran in on goal and finished under pressure. His strike proved to be vital as the game finished 1-1 and Al Shabab won on penalties, which went down in the club’s history as they lifted the Crown Prince Cup for the first time.",

Rafael Márquez earned his spot in the starting 11 for the final having featured 7 times in the tournament so far, keeping 4 clean sheets.

He added his second shortly afterwards with a tidy touch and finish into the bottom corner to seal Brazil’s victory.",
  "FUT_LEGEND_DESCR_270423": "Samuel Eto'o tasted his sweetest FIFA World Cup™ moment at the 2002 tournament in Japan. It was here where Eto’o experienced his only victory on the world’s biggest stage and, typically, Eto’o was key to the win.

What made this moment even sweeter was the fact that this was his first ever FIFA World Cup™ goal.",
  "FUT_LEGEND_DESCR_270424": "Luís Figo captained Portugal in 2006 to their second FIFA World Cup Semi-Final appearance. After leading his country to three wins from three in the group stages, Figo’s team overcame a tough Round of 16 tie against the Netherlands with a 1-0 win to setup a quarter-final meeting with England.

Unsurprisingly, Riise snuck the ball through a gap in the wall and into the net to set the tone for the afternoon as Liverpool progressed. Riise went on to win his first FA Cup.",

  "tactics.description.style.0.2": "The team will make runs for long balls into space behind the opposing back line, or up to a target man. Strikers who are fast with a good attacking positioning attribute are the best at this tactic.",

  "tactics.description.style.3.1": "A balanced style where your team presses the ball to the middle of the pitch and your team's shape is neutral.",
  "tactics.description.style.3.2": "Your team preserves their shape until the opportunity to pressure appears. Pressure when the opposition takes a heavy touch, it's a loose ball, or controlling a difficult pass facing their own goal.",
  "tactics.description.style.3.3": "After your team loses possession of the ball, your teammates will press the ball for approximately 7 seconds. This will affect player fatigue and your players could be out of position if you don't win it back during this time.",
  "tactics.description.style.3.4": "This tactic will put high pressure over opposing players on the field. This tactic may leave your team vulnerable as your players become increasingly fatigued, leading to them being pushed out of position.",

  "tactics.description.style.5.0": "Adjust your defensive team shape to be deep to give less space behind your back line for long balls and fast strikers to make runs in behind your team. Playing deep will open more spaces for long shots or more possession for the opposition team.",
  "tactics.description.style.5.1": "Adjust your defensive team shape to be balanced to keep your team in the middle of the pitch to try to win the midfield battle.",
  "tactics.description.style.5.2": "Adjust your defensive team shape to be high to help put pressure on possession teams. Your back line will be high and vulnerable for long balls in behind.",

  "tactics.description.style.8.0": "Once the team enters the attacking zone with possession players will create chances by making runs for passes into space behind the opposing back line.  Strikers who are fast with a good attacking positioning attribute are the best at this tactic.",
  "tactics.description.style.8.1": "This tactic is used for a balanced team that maintains its formation while creating attacking chances.  Players will support and make runs when they think it's the right time to do so.",
  "tactics.description.style.8.2": "Players will support more in the attacking zone, rather than going on forward runs.  This tactic strengthens a short passing game to patiently wait for the chance to attack, but will rarely provide runs penetrating the opposing defensive line.",
  "tactics.description.style.8.3": "This tactic pushes players forward deep into attacking areas, but if you lose possession of the ball you could find yourself open to a counterattack.",
